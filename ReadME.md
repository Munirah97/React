Before you can deploy your React application, you need to bundle the application using Parcel. 
Parcel generates the final HTML, CSS, and JS files and save them in the `dist` folder.

Please execute the following commands inside the example folder.
 
(1) Initialize the project: `npm init -y`
(2) Add the following line to the `package.json` file: `"source": "index.html",` . This is the souce file that contains your application.
